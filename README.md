Development Branch: feat2

Add the script overview

the structure for the better understanding of the script

We are writing the script for 100_block_neg.json

	The Qa pairs we will create will be unique as the questions used are not used in 100_block_pos.json
	So the pair we need will always lie in the 	100_block_neg.

input_file_path = "/home/stud/abedinz1/localDisk/RAG/RAG/neg_qa_pairs.json"
	Regarding this we will be creating from 100_blocks_neg.json
	the script we use is query_bulk_generation.py


I need to create the vector database seperate from the everytime script run
